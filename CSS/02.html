    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>
        Known for their strong live vocals, harmonies and powerful stage presence, Mamamoo is 
        recognized as one of the premier girl groups in K-pop.[4][5] They are highly regarded in
        the industry for their talent, and ability to cross multiple genres with their music;
        from retro, jazz, R&B concepts in their early years[6] to more contemporary hip-hop,[7]
        as well as emotional ballads.

    <h4>Achievements</h4>
    <p>
        Mamamoo rose to domestic fame in 2015 with their single "Um Oh Ah Yeah" 
        which became a sleeper hit and peaked at number three on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart. Combined with their many appearances and victories in the 
        popular music competition program Immortal Songs, this launched them into mainstream 
        recognition with the public.[10] Their following release of "You're the Best" (2016)
         from their debut studio album Melting, proved to be a commercial success and dominated 
         at least eight major music sites upon release,[11] further cementing their popularity 
         and growing momentum. In 2017, they made a splash on the international scene with their 
         fifth EP Purple. Its lead single "Yes I Am" – a song about self-confidence and 
         unashamedly being yourself, which the members took part in writing themselves – earned 
         them their first number one on the Billboard World Albums chart.
