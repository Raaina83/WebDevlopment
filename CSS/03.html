    <p>Mamamoo rose to domestic fame in 2015 with their single "Um Oh Ah Yeah" which became a
    sleeper hit and peaked at number three on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart. Combined with
    their many appearances and victories in the popular music competition program
    Immortal Songs, this launched them into mainstream recognition with the public.
    Their following release of "You're the Best" (2016) from their debut studio album
    Melting, proved to be a commercial success and dominated at least eight major music sites
    upon release, further cementing their popularity and growing momentum. In 2017, they
    made a splash on the international scene with their fifth EP Purple. Its lead single
    "Yes I Am" – a song about self-confidence and unashamedly being yourself, which the
    members took part in writing themselves – earned them their first number one on the
    Billboard World Albums chart.
