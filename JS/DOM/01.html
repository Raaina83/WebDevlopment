        Creation and Development

     <p id="description">
        In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head 
        writer Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for 
        Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books and the desire to 
        create a character with whom teens could identify.As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw 
        Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was missing in
        comic books.[16] In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine 
        crime fighter the Spider as a great influence,and in a multitude of 
        print and video interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider 
        climb up a wallâ€”adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he 
        has become unsure of whether or not this is true.[note 1][page needed] Besides the 
        name, the Spider was wanted by both the law and the criminal underworld 
        (a defining theme of Spider-Man's early years), and had through years of ceaseless 
        struggle developed a "sixth sense" which warns him of danger, the apparent 
        inspiration for Spider-Man's "spider-sense"</p>
